This is a work in progress

Recently, while commuting to work, I was driving in the straight-through lane with a car ahead of me and 
another in the left-turn-only lane. When the light turned green, 
the car in the turn-only lane suddenly cut across, 
forcing the car in front of me to brake hard. 
I slammed on my brakes as well but not quite in time, 
and I very lightly rear-ended the car ahead. 
Fortunately, neither of our cars were damaged. 
Still, I realized that if I had reacted just 100 milliseconds sooner, 
I likely would have avoided the collision entirely.

For context, the average human reaction time is around 220 milliseconds source. 
What if technology could cut that delay? A brain–computer interface, 
capable of detecting the neural signals that indicate the intention to brake, 
could activate emergency braking almost instantly—dramatically reducing reaction time 
and potentially preventing accidents.
